    <h1>Change Request Sheath Concept</h1>
    <p class="note">A compact summary of how change requests behave like refinements that require gluing work.</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>One-sentence version</h2>
    <p>
      A change request can be viewed as a refinement of scope that introduces new interfaces, and
      sheafification is the process of forcing local decisions to agree on overlaps so the project
      still forms a coherent whole.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Short paragraph (PM-friendly)</h2>
    <p>
      Model the project as overlapping “areas of responsibility” (Approach, Foundation, Interior).
      Each area carries local decisions (owner, materials, inspection status). Where areas overlap,
      decisions must agree; if they do, they “glue” into a single integrated plan (a global section).
      A change request refines the scope (splitting areas into smaller parts), which creates more
      overlap points and coordination requirements. If the old plan no longer agrees at these new
      interfaces, the mismatch highlights exactly where integration work is needed.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Slightly more mathematical (but still readable)</h2>
    <p>
      Treat each project area as an open set in a cover. A presheaf assigns local specifications to
      each open set and restriction maps to overlaps. A global section is a set of local specs that
      agree on every overlap. A change request refines the cover (splits opens into smaller opens),
      creating additional overlaps. Sheafification corresponds to enforcing the gluing condition:
      updating or reconciling local specs so that they become consistent across the refined overlaps.
